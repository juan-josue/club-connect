**Club-Connect**

Club-Connect is a matchmaking platform designed to help University of Toronto students discover clubs that align with their interests through an intuitive, AI-powered recommendation system.

---

**Overview**  
With nearly 1,500 clubs at UofT, students often struggle to find the ones that match their interests. Club-Connect streamlines this process by offering an AI-driven recommendation system and a Tinder-like swiping interface, making it easier to explore and connect with clubs that fit their preferences.

**Features**
- Personalized Club Discovery – AI categorizes clubs based on interests for tailored recommendations.
- Tinder-Like Swiping – Swipe left or right to express interest in clubs.
- Matchmaking Algorithm – Adapts based on user preferences and past interactions.
- Web Scraped Database – Extracted club data directly from UofT’s club directory.
- Secure Authentication – Uses SQLAlchemy to manage user accounts securely.
