According to Homesfirst organization (2022) around 8,500 people in Toronto are experiencing homelessness on any given day. Through ABDT we would like to raise awareness to the homelessness situation in Canada, and provide resources to those in that situation. We plan to achieve this by collaborating with non-profit organizations such as Youth Without Shelter, Toronto Alliance to End Homelessness (TAEH), Salvation Army, and local shelters. We will be arranging seminars and tabling events to raise awareness about this situation. Furthermore, we plan to take mini field trips to areas experiencing high rates of homelessness such as areas in downtown Toronto. In these mini field trips, we will meet with shelters around the GTA and drop off little care packages with goods and hygiene products. As well, this will allow group members to speak directly to shelter staff, and different organizations to increase awareness about this situation.

We aim to aid students in this struggle by providing an entry point into the industry through creating opportunities for research and industry experience for everyone, giving students a resume boost and a significant advantage over others upon graduating.

We celebrate the capacity of South Asian youth and recognize the need to address detrimental systemic notions within the South Asian community. Standing in solidarity with Black and Indigenous communities, we aim to confront disproportionate marginalizations, creating opportunities to collectively unlearn, build networks, and collaborate alongside our allies.

For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit.

The overarching objective of CARSSU is two-fold: (a) to promote and advocate for improvements to the Caribbean Studies program at the University of Toronto (St. George) and provide diverse representation and support for members of the Caribbean Studies Program and (b) to organize with its membership to advocate for the betterment of the Caribbean region and its diaspora, through knowledge sharing in social and community-based programming. CARSSU’s intent is to organize with students to advocate for the betterment of the Caribbean Studies program, while addressing the issues of Eurocentrism and lack of interdisciplinary courses amongst mainstream subject matter. Recognizing that academic experiences are closely linked to the many systemic barriers that students face in academia, CARSSU works to address these issues, while providing a space for critical thought. These spaces include and are not limited to the University of Toronto Journal of Caribbean Studies (Caribbean Quilt) published annually by CARSSU. As the only student organization that both represents Caribbean Studies students, and lobbies for the betterment of those in the region and its diaspora, CARSSU has a unique focus on academics, as well as community and social development. CARSSU strives to not only showcase the complex and profound history, political climate, and socio-cultural environment of the Caribbean region but, also to raise awareness for issues that are affecting the region and continuously hold ourselves accountable as diaspora representatives.

    "description": "In 1966, a group of University of Toronto students started Radio University, successfully establishing an independent radio station and voice for the University of Toronto community. The infant radio station grew steadily, building important associations with CJRT-FM and CHUM-FM. By the early 1970s it was clear that Radio University — now Input Radio — was reaching and representing an increasingly diverse audience. Throughout the 1970’s and 80’s, the station maintained its commitment to pursuing the issues and stories ignored by most mainstream news outlets. By doing so Input Radio and its successor CJUT developed a loyal audience in Toronto. The next obvious step was to increase the station’s broadcast range by becoming an FM station. This was accomplished in 1986, and CJUT became CIUT-FM. While continuing to reach both University of Toronto students and the broader Toronto community, the station also found new audiences all across Central and Southern Ontario. Now, thanks to Star Choice’s National Satellite Network and Webcasting through Virtuecast, CIUT-FM is bringing its unique brand of eclectic broadcasting to a global audience. At CIUT FM we feel we’ve earned the right to call ourselves Real Radio. Every day volunteers and donors keep us broadcasting the news, music and information that you won’t hear on commercial radio stations. It’s an accomplishment we’re proud of, and we need you to help us keep it happening. Your time and your donations make sure that CIUT will always be fresh, never canned. So, if community radio matters to you, please, help us keep it real. We wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates.

Taking its roots from the Hacklab, CSSC’s main objective is to support students’ academic and professional needs throughout their university career all while providing space and opportunity for community growth. The CSSC also acts as a central hub for computer science students to seek guidance, advice, and support. 1. Student Support and Guidance\nThe CSSC is an open space for Computer Science students to come in and ask questions about their university and post-university career. We cover topics such as: technology, school, mental health, personal goals, and career development. We act as liaisons to the Computer Science faculty to ensure that all students can seek appropriate support and guidance. The CSSC seeks to support students through community initiatives built upon inclusivity and empowerment. 2. Academic and Professional Growth\nThe CSSC will be collaborating with the MCS organizations and hosting multiple workshops throughout the academic year to better equip students with technological knowledge sought after by employers in the industry. We provide students with opportunities, space, and resources to work on community projects, technical interview questions, and fun technical events so students can gain experience outside of the classroom. The CSSC also aims to inform students of what options they have post-graduation with a Computer Science degree and how they can combine this degree with other fields. 3. Development of Technology Resources\nThe CSSC has devoted our technology team to develop processes and tools to help Computer Science students succeed academically and professionally. We curate resources from across the internet and produce original content all the while keeping the interest of students as the top priority. 4. Collaboration with MCS Organizations\nThe CSSC provides support to all of the clubs/societies belonging to UTM’s MCS community. We provide spaces and resources for MCS organizations and work closely with them in order to achieve common goals; some of which are: community building, academic achievements, professional development, mental wellness, diversity, equity and inclusion.

While that is important and significant, what is also important is the experience you derive. There is much more outside the laboratory setting that could help make the time spent earning your degree more enriching, educational, enjoyable, and just plain fun. CLAMPS (the Confederation of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology Students) is the annually elected executive council of the student body of the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto. CLAMPS seeks to provide assistance to M.Sc. or Ph.D. students within the department in matters pertaining to the university, academia, research, and establishing social events. Furthermore, because the department encompasses students from diverse geographies (Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, the Toronto General Hospital, the Hospital for Sick Children, Mount Sinai Hospital, St. Michael’s Hospital, Medical Science Building, Canadian Blood Services, Toronto Western Hospital) and research backgrounds (Cellular and Molecular Pathology, Clinical Biochemistry, Medical Microbiology), CLAMPS endeavors to organize various informational and social venues that will help bring members of the department together throughout the year. These include both academic events (Annual Graduate Student Research Day; Special Seminar sessions) and social events (Annual BBQ, Socials, Sports, and Excursions). Each of these environments aspire to ultimately increase student participation in the department, while fostering friendships and contacts. While CLAMPS will remain fiscally responsible each year, it will also try to organize and subsidize as many academic and social events as possible in achieving its goal of increasing student spirit and participation in the department.

    "description": "The purpose of the organization is to educate and raise awareness for Dementia and its causes, as well as its effects on those who are diagnosed with it and their loved ones. We will have a particular focus on Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. While diseases associated with dementia are commonly seen today, with the highest prevalence in seniors, they remain vastly misunderstood. Individuals affected by dementia often display unusual social behaviours, leading to feelings of frustration and distress from their family members and friends who may not quite understand why they may act in such ways. Through campaigning, knowledge spreading, and in-person events, this group aims to advocate for the needs of patients suffering from dementia, while elucidating the causes and both behavioural and physiological effects of such diseases. This organization, therefore, aims to contribute to the fight against dementia by spreading knowledge and educating the general population on the biological and sociological components of such prevalent illnesses.

    "description": "Demographic decline is a significant global trend characterized by falling birth rates and aging populations in many countries. This phenomenon is important to pay attention to for several reasons: Economic Impact – A shrinking workforce can lead to reduced economic productivity and increased pressure on social support systems. Let’s say it takes 1000 workers to maintain the current infrastructure, so then what happens if the available number of workers fall to 500? This increases the risk of infrastructure collapse. Innovation Challenges – With fewer young people, there may be a decline in innovation and technological progress. If everyone is being dragged into maintaining infrastructure and fixing AC in future heatwaves, then there are less people to innovate green tech. Healthcare Strain – An aging population puts increased pressure on healthcare systems and eldercare services. As people live longer they do not necessarily live younger, and often do not have the capacity to work in the same way that young people do. For these reasons we seek to discuss the subject of falling birth rates, demographics, and promote awareness of pronatalism. Join us to prevent the demographic collapse together.

    "description": "Friends of the Ear Friends of the Ear Friends of the Ear! In this modern age of in-ear earbuds, chest-pounding concerts, and ear shattering bars and parties, our ears need a friend! If you have ever come home from an event with a ring in your ears, or needed to ask someone to yell so you could hear them, your ears have been tired out (or even damaged). Your hair cells (those that detect sound waves in your cochleas, not the ones on your head, silly) die if they are overworked, and don’t grow back, ever (a long time!). Much of that damage nowadays comes from loud music, which many university students experience almost every week. But now for the good news: all you need to do to preserve your hearing is fill those ears with some foam – earplugs, that is. It protects your hair cells from tiring, makes the music sound cleaner, and even makes it easier to hear others when they talk to you at loud events! At Friends of the Ear, we promote hearing protection (we might even make it cool one day) at events that pose a threat to our ears. We also raise funds for charities that donate hearing aids to those that need them. We tend to take out hearing for granted, but there are those who cannot, and if we can raise enough money to give just one of those people the gift of hearing, we will have accomplished our mission – to be Friends of the Ear.

It does so in two principal ways: First, it organizes events in which important topics of the day are discussed and explored. These can be panel discussions, guest lectures, or more formal debating events. Whatever the format, students participate with invited speakers and panelists, both in the event itself and in the question and discussion periods which are a part of each event. These events not only provide the student population at large with opportunities for public discussion, they also give committee members and volunteers the chance to learn how to organize and promote such public discussions. Second, the Debates & Dialogue Committee co-operates with the Debating Club in enriching the opportunities for student debating. The Committee organizes several tournaments in House and liaises with the Debating Club over the selection of, and fundraising for, students to represent Hart House in the World Debating Championship.\nAlthough these two principal activities are different, they are bound together as ways to enable students to enhance their skills at participating, in the broadest sense, in the wider world of dialogue and expression that sustains our political life and allows for a multiplicity of voices in civil society in general.

Provide a place for students interested in the Christian faith to hear about the Gospel, share their thoughts about the Christian faith, read the Chinese and English Bible, and join biblical study sessions (available in Hebrew, Greek, Chinese and English);\n2. Provide a weekly meeting place for students of the Christian faith to meet, worship, and fellowship through the singing of hymns, studying of the Bible, hearing of biblically based messages, and discussions of Chinese and English Christian books;\n3. Accommodate students with agape love and warmth so as to provide them with a place and opportunity to get to know each other, become friends, and help each other in their academic pursuits and daily life, especially for the accommodation of Chinese international students and Chinese Canadian students, but not in any way excluding other students from joining the group or its events;\n4.

    "description": "HOUSE (Housing Our University Students Equitably) Toronto was established in 2024 to improve the housing situation for University of Toronto students, workers and members of the wider community. We are students, professors, staff, alumni and community members working towards:\n– Organizing our community around housing issues\n– Educating our community on their housing rights\n– Advocacy with the university, all levels of government, housing providers and others Our primary goal is to facilitate the creation of new affordable housing at or near University of Toronto’s three main campuses – St. George, Mississauga and Scarborough. There is a unique opportunity to create affordable housing co-operatives with renewed interest from all levels of government to fund affordable housing. There are over 150 housing co-ops throughout Toronto, many of which have been built through union support; however, very few new affordable housing buildings have been built since the 1990’s because of neoliberal budget cuts to affordable housing programs. The committee is working to build capacity and partnerships, conduct research and applying for funding towards our goal of creating high-quality affordable housing. We hope to see new affordable housing completed by 2028. We wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates.

    "description": "MusicBox Children’s Charity (MBCC) is a youth-run registered non-profit organization that strives to provide music education opportunities to financially, socially, or physically disadvantaged children and youth. A formal education in music should not be a privilege limited to those who can support it. We feel that music is an integral part of a child’s early development, with benefits reaching far beyond the child’s developmental stage. Vulnerable children should be granted the same opportunities for growth and development that are available to their peers. Through our partnership with the College Montrose Children’s Place, FCJ Refugee Centre, Robertson House, and General Crerar Public School, we bring music to young children who need it the most. We fully subscribe to the concept of music as a developmental tool, and to its beneficial effects on a child’s social, academic, and emotional development. As a youth-driven initiative, the directors of MBCC are strong proponents of “self-help” within a community. The needs of a community are best met by those living in it, and who better to enhance our programs than the youth themselves. Our youth volunteers with significant musical achievement provide mentorship to our participants in group and one-on-one classes. Our approach is two-tiered. While we seek to enhance our children’s educations with the inclusion of music, we also hope to enrich the personal development of our volunteer youths who gain important interpersonal skills, self-enrichment, and fulfillment through their participation in MBCC’s programs. We currently offer private and group instrumental lessons for children aged 7-12 as well as early childhood music appreciation group classes for those aged 3-5, and 0-3. In the constant pursuit of growth, we are always looking to expand our programming! We wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates.

Ordinary tourists are given the means to change the lives of the locals they visit. After seeing first-hand the serious lack of medical supplies in Cuba in 1990, Dr. Ken Taylor and his wife Denise—from St. Catharines, Ontario—started taking medical supplies to remote areas in Cuba. Soon others who were traveling to Cuba began approaching them to take medical supplies too, and the Not Just Tourists phenomenon started. Since it’s inception 30 years ago, NJT has spread to chapters across the world, with over 10,000 suitcases and 1,000,000+ lbs of medical supplies and equipment delivered to 82 countries. Not Just Tourists receives donations from Canada’s largest hospitals, clinics, medical suppliers and individuals. The supplies donated are typically gauze, bandages, surgical instruments, masks, gloves, antiseptics, IV kits, urinary supplies and birthing kits. The supplies are packed by volunteers into suitcases during weekly “packing parties”. Travellers sign up and are given the suitcases to deliver to remote clinics where they are needed. The project does not accept funding, is non-political, non-religious. Everything is accomplished through volunteers.

    "description": "Stem cell transplantation is a critical treatment for over 80 blood diseases, including various types of blood cancer. Since stem cell matches are based on shared genetic markers, the best potential match typically comes from a sibling. However, the likelihood of finding a compatible sibling donor is only 25%, meaning the vast majority of patients rely on the stem cell registry to find a suitable match. When searching for a donor outside the family, the chances of finding a compatible match are higher if the donor shares the same ethnic background. Unfortunately, only 32% of stem cell registrants come from ethnically diverse backgrounds, which significantly reduces the chances of a successful match for patients with non-Caucasian ancestry. OtherHalf (www.chinesestemcell.ca) is affiliated with the Canadian Blood Services and is dedicated to addressing this disparity by increasing ethnic diversity within Canada’s stem cell donor database, with a particular focus on the Chinese Canadian community. Through targeted stem cell drives and educational campaigns, we aim to promote health equity and ensure that all individuals in need of a stem cell transplant have an equal opportunity to find a life-saving donor.

Sayo (Public Relation/Festival Co-director 04-06 and volunteer since 03) Philosophies Recognizing Conflict\nVolunteers identify conflict and illustrate how conflicts can become progressively more serious. The curriculum teaches a variety of non-violent techniques that enable students to prevent conflicts from becoming violent matters. Example: “conflict escalator” which demonstrates that conflict continues to ascend unless they are able to stop it. Communication\nStudents are able to practice the art of communication through various activities. Communication is a key elements when de-escalating conflicts and withstanding tough times. Example: “I statement” which students use to express their feelings to overcome difficult situations. Respecting Cultural Difference\nVolunteers engage a series of activities with students where they can learn to respect similarities and differences among each other. This enables students to realize that each individual is unique while still part of a group. Example: group interactions about name meanings, culture and stereotyping.

Meetings will be held once per week. Our vision is to create a close-knit group of 20-30 or so regular members who hold interest in Continental philosophy (but not necessarily restricted to it). Students and faculty of all backgrounds are welcome. The Philosophy Discussion Group will not tolerate racism, homophobia, sexism, or any other such discrimination.

This discourse begins with a question that is then addressed in roughly three parts: the asking of a question: how can we obtain a more positive relation to technology?\nfirst part of discourse: the problem (?) -> outlining the situation, according to Heidegger, that we find ourselves in -> technology as the defining metaphysical condition of modern times third part of the discourse:  another possible solution -> critiquing Heidegger’s diagnosis and aiming to solve things at the broader social level -> towards the democratic rationalization & critical constructivism of Feenberg (Marcuse, Habermas, Foucault, Latour, Feenberg) I hope to encourage engineering (and other STEM) students (if that’s you hello!) to join and participate with the hope of, by having those with (in the words of Heidegger) a more practical-technical comportment towards the world informed by a technological rationality, generating interesting discourse that would (1) not be possible with only philosophy students, (2) is sorely needed. Any kind of future regulation to guide technological development will require a mediation between technical discourse and philosophico-juridical discourse and we may, by having engineering students, encourage instances of such.

    "description": "The Positive Psychology Student Club (PPSC) aims to create a safe environment for students to rethink mental wellness through the lens of positive psychology. To date, much of psychology has been concerning the questions of “what is wrong with me?” and “how can I be fixed?”. Positive psychology is the scientific study of what makes our lives worth living, where the goal is to make normal life more fulfilling! Differing from the traditional approach of mental wellness advocacy, we hope to divert the attention from “what is wrong with me?” to “what is right with me?”. Under academic pressure, students can oftentimes be sidetracked by the achievement of others. We aim to deliver educational content on means you can use to reflect on your past accomplishment, start noticing the little things that bring you joy, and eventually allow you to realize how awesome you are! The deliverables will be in the form of open discussion via virtual gathering and onboarding panelists that specialize in the study of positive psychology to provide professional insights.

    "description": "The Psyche Society is an aesthetic club that seeks to answer the question, “What is beauty?” Every two weeks, the President and the executive committee will put forward an aesthetic idea to debate. It will usually follow a format like “Is suffering beautiful?” or “Is nature beautiful?” The President gives a short introduction to the topic summarising the relevant literature. Then, three club volunteers put forward objects of beauty and well-thought-out arguments for why they are beautiful. Anyone can bring forward any object of beauty, whether artistic, performed, recorded, physical, bought, or stolen. Then, they give a presentation for what makes them beautiful, drawing on philosophy, aesthetics, or whatever human discipline they like. There are a few short questions after each presentation, and then, after the presentations, there is a general discussion where anyone can ask a question until the end of the meeting. The goal is to help members better find and understand the beauty in the world around them. At each meeting, the conclusions and key points of each discussion and contribute to the Psyche Society’s ethos for that year, which may be published as an annual review at the end of the year. Occasionally we will host events of beauty such as nature trips, music shows, plays, poetry readings and pub nights. You can join, whoever you are, regardless of your academic background, ethnicity, race, religion or language. All the Society’s discussions are held in English, but works of other languages are eagerly welcomed if they are explained clearly. The Society is secular by design, but holds the literary ideal of the goddess Psyche as a symbol of its purpose. Thus, each meeting will begin with a symbolic President’s address to Psyche which members may take part in if they choose. The Psyche society welcomes all members’ beliefs, but has not a dust-mote of tolerance for discourse or acts that attack members in their person or for their belonging to a certain group. Neither do we tolerate any discourse or actions that undermine the effective functioning of the club. Violate these rules and you are out in two shakes of a lamb’s tail. The Society is driven by love for beauty, not to prove anyone’s intelligence or rhetorical skill. It prefers not to host people who only like to hear themselves talk. If you love beauty and want it to take up a greater part in your life, you’re welcome here. The Psyche Society is, at its core, a group of friends and kind compatriots with whom a common enjoyment for beauty is shared. More details will appear close to the clubs fair and inscription date.

We are a catalyst for social innovation and transformation. Regenesis established The Youth Food Centre in 2017 at 596 Spadina, which provides a space for people to come together to grow, cook, share and advocate for good food. This includes sustainable and local food procurement, as well as encouraging students to grow their own food in the backyard. This ties into The Dig In! Campus Agriculture Network, which is another Regenesis initiative. Dig In! exists to support, empower and grow small-scale, sustainable food production at the University of Toronto. Regenesis U of T also runs a Free Store out of the 596 Spadina space, which provides items for free to those in need, and encourages community members to give away the items they no longer want in their lives. By re-homing these items, Regenesis promotes awareness on waste reduction, wasteful consumption, and the repurposing of items. Regenesis U of T seeks to increase the awareness around environmental issues and empower members of the community to adapt sustainable behaviours.

The UofT dance community, despite its apparent size, is in reality quite removed from the larger UofT community. We firmly believe that dance is an art that everyone can appreciate and experience if they should desire to. Often what discourages an individual from dance, especially older individuals, is the exclusivity characteristic of experienced dancers forming closed-off competitive or training teams. Here at REV, we aim to break down such barriers, foster community, as well as promote the beauty of dance without intimidation and stipulation. We host weekly open classes, which any UofT student (or anyone who is willing to pay the Goldring entrance fee) can join. Open classes are led by experienced dancers, whom we know through friends or by association. We believe that UofT, given its size and scope, really benefits from smaller communities set up within, where students feeling lost within a sea of students, can find us, find dance, and find his or her place. This is what we ultimately offer and have been offering for the past few years. Through REV, friendships have flourished, as well as the overall passion for dance. We see our members venture out into the Toronto dance community and take additional classes, join sessions, and befriend dancers on their own after joining REV.

For these competitions, we build a 50 kg Mars Rover with a robotic arm and construct scientific payloads for various missions including the search for life! It is our mission to form a multidisciplinary team of engineers dedicated to the development and implementation of innovative technology designed specifically for space exploration. The hostility, unfamiliarity, and unknowns related to environments beyond the Earth’s atmosphere pose significant challenges to engineers and scientists. With a rapidly growing aerospace and robotics industry coupled with increasingly accessible and affordable technology, the underpinning goal of RSX will be to provide all of its members with a comprehensive, practical, and concrete understanding of space exploration to meet these challenges. As space exploration is highly multidisciplinary, RSX will welcome engineers and scientists from diverse backgrounds, interests, and skill sets. However, RSX also welcomes anyone who has an interest in space robotics, regardless of experience level. We believe that anyone who is willing to learn is able to thrive in RSX, and we are happy to foster their growth to become the next scientists and engineers.

    "description": "Rotaract is a Rotary-sponsored service club for young people ages 18 to 30. The name is taken from a combination of the words “Rotary” and “action”. The purpose of Rotaract is to provide an opportunity for individuals to enhance their knowledge and skills in order to assist in their personal development, while also addressing the physical and social needs of their communities through a framework of friendship and community service. Rotaract clubs organize a variety of projects and activities, depending on the interests of the club members. However, three main areas of focus include professional development, leadership development, and service projects (both locally and internationally). Rotaract clubs are an important part of Rotary’s extended family. Rotary International is a worldwide service organization for leading business and professional leaders, with more than 1.2 million members in over 31,000 Rotary clubs. Each Rotaract club is sponsored by a local Rotary club and together they work in cooperation as partners in service. Rotaract has evolved quickly in its short but dynamic history. In the early 1960s, Rotary clubs around the world began to sponsor university youth groups as community service projects. The 1967-68 Rotary International (RI) president, Luther H. Hodges, and the RI Board of Directors considered this club activity to have international relevance, and Rotaract was approved in 1968 as an official program for Rotary clubs. The first club chartered was the Rotaract Club of North Charlotte, North Carolina, USA, on 13 March 1968. Several decades later, the Rotaract program has grown into a strong, international network of 7,300 clubs in more than 150 countries and geographical areas. Rotaract’s 145,000 members are young men and women (ages 18-30) who serve the needs of their communities, widen their personal and professional contacts, and increase their understanding of the world around them. The Rotaract Club of the University of Toronto is one of these clubs and is committed to leadership, understanding, professionalism, and philanthropy in the U of T community. We welcome all students in all areas of study, both at the undergraduate and graduate level to join us in our efforts to provide service above self.

Students interested in the sciences, whether its life sciences or physical sciences, are often required to chose one or two domains they find most interesting out of all the sciences to pursue in depth in university. As a result, students who may have predilections in many different scientific fields, are subsequently limited to only studying one or maybe two of these fields. Yet every subject in science are closely intertwined, and build off of each other to explain greater phenomenons. Consequently, our society aims to bridge this divide between various scientific fields by creating an environment where  students come together to exchange knowledge about all of these different fields, offering the members a holistic overview of the sciences as a whole. Besides, this group also serves as an opportunity for its members to dabble in scientific fields other than the one of their major(s), that they might not be familiar with or might have an interest in. In other words, this group is an opportunity to exchange with people who might share different or similar interest, and to learn about other fields, which overall, all tie together. Through social events, you will have the opportunity to network with people, to broaden your field of interest and to promote personal professional/career development.

SSICSIM is unique as it solely operates Model United Nations (MUN) style “crisis committees” on a variety of themes including those of a historical, fictional and contemporary nature. Unlike traditional MUN committees, SSICSIM delegates are not only required to debate issues from a static and distinct perspective, but rather they are challenged to “think outside of the box” by responding, adapting, and reacting to evolving scenarios that demonstrate real time crisis situations. As the premier MUN “crisis conference” in Ontario, SSICSIM hosts high school students and faculty from across the province. Among other things, SSICSIM strives to provide high school students an opportunity to: think critically about pressing global issues and our ever changing society; stretch their imaginations to address issues through creative solutions; network with university students; and, develop leadership skills such as public speaking, cooperation, debating and professionalism. Likewise, university students who assist in the planning and execution of this event are provided an opportunity to gain their own leadership experience. The Fifteenth Session of the SSICSIM Conference will be held in October 2025. We wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates.

Over the past year, we’ve organized events like Café gatherings, French film outings, and academic speakers’ sessions. This year, we’ve expanded with activities such as Crêpes Cafés, French Movie Nights, and a Valentine’s Day Origami session. Our partnerships with clubs like Hard-Hat Café, the Language Initiative Exchange Club, and the French Course Union further enhance our collaborative spirit. SFS offers a welcoming environment where students can network, build linguistic and technical skills, and explore opportunities in the French engineering industry. We stand out as the only club at Skule dedicated to helping students practice French, and we’re always looking to grow our community.

To combat the difficulties of first-year transitioning, research-backed accountability partner systems are used to connect individuals with other first-year students to increase the likelihood of goal development and execution. Through accountability partners, students have a friend or peer to hold them accountable and create a safe outlet for discussion about adapting to university life. This program was designed with the issues first-year students face in mind. Namely, imposter syndrome, mispredicting the feasibility of tasks, and lack of information on goal setting and organization.  Educational workshops and events on personalized study strategies, habit formation techniques, and well-being are also provided to university students throughout the year.

The Material Merge publishes original articles related to our subject matter — material culture and semiotics. All undergraduate students from any program at U of T are welcome to submit essays, research projects and reviews, as well as some creative pieces. What we fundamentally want from papers is that they are original, engaging, and well-made. In winter 2023 we organized our first-ever magazine! In the fall semester, we will be collaborating with Victoria College’s Material Culture and Semiotics program to create a conference based on our subject matter. The journal is subdivided into 2 sections. The first is “Symbolic culture”, which explores the meaning we give to objects through a cultural lens. The second is “Material fusion”, which is about the blurring division between people and the objects they make. We wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates.

Our club is a member of Judo Ontario, and through it Judo Canada, the Canadian Olympic Committee and the International Judo Federation. By philosophy and practice within an academic environment, our club is focused on education and physical culture. Judo as developed by its founder, Jigoro Kano, is designed to be practised in a full-contact manner while maintaining the least possible injury risk to its practitioners. Any techniques designed to purposefully injure or inflict pain on another individual are not tolerated within the club. The two principles “Mutual Welfare and Benefit” and “Maximum Efficiency” underpin all that a judo practitioner does, particularly in protecting the physical and emotional well-being of all participants. Accordingly, practice of Judo leads to development of character, self-confidence, self-discipline, physical fitness and healthy values in relationships with club members and others. We believe that everyone can benefit from our teachings and as such we do our best to support beginners and to initiate the journeys of future practitioners.

    "description": "Mission Statement of the Wandering Craft The goal of this group is to provide a monthly anecdotal source of information, in the form of a newspaper. This information will be based on the group’s niche interests and passions. In this way, the Wandering Craft newspaper would be an alternative news source, a forum where people can create dialogue surrounding interests. We will cover a wide range of topics such as, Myths, Philosophy, Theories, Fitness, Culture, and Food. The hope is to have many different participants coming together to provide their own personal perspectives, and also passions, which hopefully can help students in UofT understand and be exposed to differing points of view. In this way, the main strength of this paper will revolve around seeing the value in each of our own niche passions, stories, and ideas. However, coming from the perspective of young university students we will present details of more nuanced interests and takes in an accessible way that will allow people to see deeper truths and meanings in different stories that perhaps they would not have seen before. During our group meetings we would use the time to listen to each other’s interests, things each of us have been thinking about, things we have realized, and perspectives that the group members have had that they think could help other people to see things in a new way. For example, we may talk about masculinity and how certain cultural expectations that are placed on boys growing up actually seem to breed toxic masculinity, which ultimately damages more than just men. This is my personal perspective and I believe it could be one that would be valuable for other men, and women to read. However, I want to be able to talk about other people’s experiences and perspectives that are very different than my own. As an undergrad, there is a wide range of topics covered in class that do not have to do with the specific interest we have in the subject that made us enter into that degree. In this paper, our writers will be able to write about more nuanced topics in depth in the subject that perhaps they are studying. While conducting interviews we will ask students to express their passions in particular subjects more specifically. Likewise, when talking to professors we will make a point of asking them about specific loves within their subject and ask questions we might have about distinct subjects.

    "description": "The Falun Dafa Club at U of T aims to provide an open environment for members and affiliates of U of T to freely practice Falun Gong (also known as Falun Dafa). Falun Dafa is a traditional Chinese spiritual practice for mind and body. The practice combines five gentle and slow exercises with a moral philosophy centered on the principles: Truthfulness “真” (zhen), Compassion “善” (shan), and “Tolerance “忍” (ren). It teaches that these qualities are universal and fundamental, and by assimilating into them, one can attain true wisdom, physical health, and a serene state of mind. As any practitioner can validate with their own experience, Falun Dafa is beneficial for relieving stress and achieving mental & physical well-being, which includes improved energy levels, focus, clarity, and peace of mind. Falun Dafa is practiced freely by millions in over 150 countries. However, like other persecuted groups such as Uyghurs Muslims, Tibetan Buddhists, etc., Falun Gong has been experiencing ongoing persecution by the ruling Communist Party in China since 1999, with millions imprisoned for up to 16 years. More information about the persecution can be found here. Regular activities of the Falun Dafa Club include weekly exercises and periodic experience-sharing sessions. Additionally, as Falun Dafa has deep roots in traditional Chinese culture, we host cultural events to introduce this rich heritage. Anyone is welcome to join our sessions regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious background, political beliefs, etc. Participation in all of our activities is on a voluntary basis and free of charge.

However, 80% of patients do not have a suitable match in their family, and must find an unrelated donor. Canada’s stem cell donor-database is used to match potential donors to patients. Individuals age 17-35 can register to join this database at stem cell drives, where they swab their cheeks to provide a tissue sample for a DNA test. Finding a match for transplant is difficult: currently, over 1000 Canadians cannot find a match. The Stem Cell Club aims to strengthen Canada’s stem cell donor-database (www.stemcellclub.ca). We seek to recruit the most-needed stem cell donors, and advance health equity by improving representation of non-Caucasians (including Aboriginal Peoples) on Canada’s donor-database. Our club trains students to advocate for patients in need of stem cell transplant, and to develop leadership and teamwork skills. We instruct them to secure informed consent and to identify and correct medical errors. Our goal is to recruit and train hundreds of volunteers to advocate for patients in need of stem cell transplant, and present all students at UofT with the opportunity to register as stem cell donors.

An accessibility club that fosters monthly discussion about disability issues and aims to spread awareness.

There are many disability-related clubs and councils out there. But each of them tends to focus on one disability and does not provide students with the chance to form a community, share personal experiences, or a space to educate those who do not have a disability.

Music is an essential part of any culture, reflecting and shaping societal values and emotions. From the enchanting melodies of traditional Beijing operas to the heartwarming strains of native Taiwanese folk songs, and from the passionate expressions of English Romanticism to the soulful tunes of American country rock, music has the power to connect us all. In today’s rapidly evolving world, where technology often reduces face-to-face interaction, Allegro Choir strives to revive this crucial form of communication. By performing songs that represent Chinese and other cultures, we hope to engage with and celebrate the diverse communities that make up our global society. Since our humble beginnings as a student-led club in 2007, Allegro Choir has grown into a semi-professional ensemble, delighting audiences with our captivating performances. This school year, we will continue our weekly rehearsals and plan to perform at numerous events, culminating in our highly anticipated annual year-end concert. The Allegro Choir is not only about making music; it’s also a supportive and inclusive environment where music enthusiasts can learn new skills, forge life-long friendships, and create cherished memories. We invite all U of T students with a passion for singing and an interest in learning Chinese to join our musical family.

We show students that university life does not have to be a lonely journey, but rather it can be an opportunity to meet new people, and to have new opportunities. We get involved in many outreach programs like Adopt-a-Student Day and our peer mentoring program, which allows 1st and 2nd-year students to be paired up with upper-year students who are available to guide them through their university journey. We also have a scholarship program every year for new students of Portuguese descent who come to the University to study. Our members are not all necessarily of Portuguese descent – some are Portuguese, most Luso-Canadian and others from other nationalities. Our only requirements to be a member are having an interest in the Portuguese culture, being a dedicated person, and being a team member. It is in the hands of our members to promote our message. Each member has the right to speak out. We have our Social Coordinators who plan events, discuss the details and plan out when, where, and how the event is to happen. Our secretary stays in contact with other clubs, events, and news outlets and relays the information to the other group members. The secretary is also the person whom others contact if they want to apply for the scholarship or need specific information about our association. Our web designer designs our website and updates it with any news and upcoming events. Our Treasurer is responsible for our financial affairs. They control the expenses versus the profits and are responsible for working out our budgets for our events. The President and Vice-President are the contact people for specific problems or concerns that some may have. They are the people who decide the positions and have the right to decide who is committed and responsible and who is fulfilling their tasks. They are also responsible for getting the club’s recognition and any specific campus rights they may require. Above all, all of our members are students themselves, so we have to balance our duties and schedules, which is not an easy task. We are all friends, and we enjoy being part of a small but growing group. Many other students are aware of us and get involved during an event but decide that they do not have the time to attend the meetings of the UTPA. For the members who are part of the UTPA, it is a comfortable and fun environment. It is a chance to make new friends and to plan and develop new contacts. We celebrate the end of every UTPA year with a scholarship dinner, our “Primavera Gala,” at which we reward our Luso-Canadian scholarship winners who have been admitted to the University of Toronto. They are also featured in our annual magazine, “Origins,” which includes all of our events during that school year and news that may be important for anyone interested in joining. This year, the UTPA is hoping to have a fantastic year, one that we can make the founders and past members of the UTPA proud of. We will leave the constitution with a few words that one of our past members had expressed towards the UTPA: “In a school that is so big and where it seems that you are outnumbered, where everyone seems to be successful and where many times you feel lost, having a place to belong like the UTPA has made me comfortable and confident. It has made my university years much easier. Thank you, UTPA team.” I am a Luso-Portuguese, and I was a previous UTPA member.

This division has two co-directors, one for each gender, to ensure everyone feels comfortable. We also have an anonymous complaint form for members to voice any concerns.

In April 2009, U of T clinched the Ontario Universities Taekwondo Competitive League (OUTCL) inter-collegiate tournament, coming in first place overall. In November 2009, the U of T Taekwondo Team competed in Master Chong’s World Class Taekwondo Tournament at Buffalo State College in Buffalo, N.Y., UTTO’s first international competition. The competitive team has competed in OUTCL tournaments and many local tournaments organised by the Ontario Taekwondo Association in the past years. In 2016, UTTO organised the University League, a chance for students to spar students from other university clubs. UTTO is not only about learning and practising Taekwondo. UTTO organises numerous social events throughout the year, including pub nights, board breaking seminar, and our annual trip to Hart House Farm as a way to get to know fellow UTTO members and create a mini-UTTO family.

Our mission and mandate revolve around harnessing the potential of open geospatial data to benefit humanitarian efforts, support underrepresented communities, our everyday lives and the environment. Our missions are to 1) empower marginalized and underrepresented communities by putting them on the map—literally and figuratively and 2) harness the power of citizen science in our everyday lives Our club thrives on teamwork. Members collaborate to update existing maps, fill in data gaps for underserved regions, and collect data on environmental biodiversity and street-level imagery. By leveraging platforms like iNaturalist and Mapillary, we contribute not only to humanitarian causes but also to environmental conservation and urban planning efforts. We foster a supportive, diverse community of students and volunteers who are passionate about geospatial data’s transformative power. Our mapping assists the Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières to address key global challenges, from improving healthcare access to enhancing disaster preparedness.
